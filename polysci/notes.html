<p><strong>Purpose of Political Behavior</strong> ~ <a href="reading-notes.md#Rationality">rationality</a></p>
<p>Constitution</p>
<ul>
<li>supposed to be a living document</li>
<li>design was political, <em>compromises</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Values &amp; political preferences</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>values</code></strong>: durable, core sense of what is good, valuable, worthwhile in life, and what is bad, to be avoided, harmful. Related to <em>Personality</em> and conduct. People who associate voluntarily tend to have similar values. Persist over time, and influence political preferences.
<ul>
<li>Not a function of intelligence or availability of information.</li>
<li>Facts are most persuasive when audience has weakly held values / beliefs</li>
<li>To <em>win</em> an argument, you have to identify the values driving your audience’s opinions, then bring facts to bear which say something / are relevant to those opinions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Structure of values is called <strong>ideology</strong>.
<ul>
<li>An organized set of values and political preferences.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Freedom, Order, and Equality</strong></p>
<pre><code>Equality  liberal           communitarian
  |
  |
  |       libertarian       conservative
Freedom -------------------- Order</code></pre>
<p>Freedom vs Order and Civil Liberties</p>
<ul>
<li>Prof says typically stronger social order (less liberty) correlates with less crime</li>
<li>Examples: restrictions on porn, abortion, legalization cannabis, criminalization flag burning, teaching religion in school, more police power.</li>
<li>Liberals, historically:
<ul>
<li>Opposed to gov’t power to influence restrictions on porn, drug use, or implement teaching religion.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Freedom vs Equality - Civil Rights &amp; Civil Liberties</p>
<ul>
<li>Civil rights, social welfare, health care</li>
<li>Do we use govt power to promote equality, or allow more personal freedom?</li>
<li>“Life, Liberty and Pursuit of Happiness”</li>
<li>libertarian = (0, 0) on (freedom-&gt; order, freedom-&gt; equality)
<ul>
<li>might want govt-sponsored health care + decriminalization of prostitution <!-- todo what is this - how to characterize ideology? --></li>
</ul></li>
<li>conservative = (1, 0)</li>
<li>liberal = (0, 1)</li>
<li>communitarian = (1,1)
<ul>
<li>tend to prefer strong use of gov authority to promote social order as well as equality</li>
<li>tight-knit community.</li>
<li>people know one another, buy into social arrangements, promote equality within community.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Socialism</p>
<ul>
<li>State &amp; economy</li>
<li>Strong control of economy by the state –&gt; more aligned w/ liberal</li>
</ul>
<p>Communism</p>
<ul>
<li>State &amp; Economy + Structure of politics itself</li>
</ul>
<p>Fascism - doesn’t fit into this picture.</p>
<p>LGBTQ Rights</p>
<ul>
<li>Case 1: –missed–</li>
<li>More persuasive on freedom grounds than liberty grounds [??]</li>
<li>Case 2: Person fired for coming out</li>
</ul>
<p>Liberalism</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A branch of enlightened political thought - John Locke.
<ul>
<li>People have rights, Gov’t exists to protect them</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Modern political ideology (progressive) <!-- todo clarify difference, see what AOC said --></li>
</ol>
<p>Progressivism</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Reformist historical era - Ted Rosevelt</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Two Approaches to the Operation of Democracy</strong> Locke - limited government</p>
<ul>
<li>Goal = prevent future tyrannical rule</li>
<li>problem: people <em>can’t</em> become well-informed on all topics involved in a democracy.</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Majoritarianism: majority gets what it wants
<ul>
<li>Example problem: Mojave desert. Should town put in sidewalks?
<ul>
<li>Townspeople (40%): YES - go to town halls, understand costs.</li>
<li>Rural people (60%): MEH - don’t care, know that it would cost money, so they vote NO.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Example: 2016 Presidential Election &amp; Electoral College
<ul>
<li>Electoral College in part created to prevent popular vote from electing demagogue.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Pluralism
<ul>
<li>says that informed people who have strong stake so system should be tuned to pay attention to them over lesser informed majority.</li>
<li>issues of inequality</li>

<h1 id="lecture-8-1---bureaucracy">Lecture 8-1 - Bureaucracy</h1>
<p>Bureaucracy Structure: - 2.7 million employees, 15 depts with ~270 agencies - Definitions: - <code>federal bureaucracy</code>: the 15 cabinet departments and their ~270 agencies, as well as ~140 independent agencies, commissions, and government corporations of the executive branc; it implements policy. - <strong>ex</strong> US Forest Service - <strong>ex</strong> Red Rock –&gt; president via chain of bureaucracy - <code>bureaucracy</code>: generic term for an organization with specialized functions internally, inflexible adherence to fixed rules, and hierarchy - <strong>ex</strong> the DMV, UCSB Registrar - <strong>ex</strong> FedEx, Amazon, Starbucks, UPS. - <code>bureaucratic</code>: a usually derogatory term suggesting inflexibility and apparently unproductive insistence on adherence to rules - <code>clientele</code> - eg Depts of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy. Purpose: Assist and promote an industry or other group - <strong>ex</strong>: Department of Interior -&gt; Forest. Logging -&gt; Forestry - <code>regulatory</code>: eg FDA, EPA - control actions of industru…… - <code>redistributive</code> - collect taxes and redistribute - <code>maintenance</code> - Misconceptions - bureaucracies are slow - in fact, they can be fast. Eg Starbucks - Different bureaucracies optimized for / tuned for different purposes - (oversight by congress, accuracy of something, etc) - Fed bureaucracy size - seems to get bigger and bigger, but thats a misconception - Scope of contry has grown a lot - things we want government to be involved in - local employment increasing - fed civilian employment as % of workforce is decreasing - democratic-ness - not regulated by constitution - How is it controlled? What are its politics?</p>
<h2 id="ingredients-for-bureaucracies">7 Ingredients for Bureaucracies</h2>
<p><strong>7 Ingredients for Bureaucracies</strong> 1. Internal desire for autonomy and growth. - not just property of Bcs, its people too. - People advocate for more power for their own job / org. 2. Legal and procedural discretion - <strong>ex</strong> NWS, - <strong>non-ex</strong>: IRS 3. extent f publc attention - <strong>ex</strong> social security: under public scrutiny - <strong>ex</strong> minerals management: manages oil &amp; gas on public lands. Manages access to oil etc. Public doesn’t care at all. 4. structure of interest group pressure - Some agencies face strong 2-sided pressure. - <strong>ex</strong> EPA under pressure from likes of GM, Sierra Club. - Sometimes pressure is lopsided. - <strong>ex</strong>: Boeing pressure on FAA <!-- todo what is the pressure --> - Agencies controlling industru but ind is able to control agency - cong. pressure either one - “Industry has <strong>captured agency</strong>” when influence is great enough - <strong>ex</strong> Boeing 737 MAX – <strong>regulatory capture</strong> - Boeing got FAA to pass law / policy allowing Boeing to do their own safety inspections. THey got Congress to allow it - Boeing got congress to provide oversight over FAA to exert influence &amp; - aerospace industry would head the board. - Europe grounded all 737 MAX jets. US initially did nothing - Boeing was under pressure from Airbus competitor. - Now we know that going back to 2012 auditors couldn’t raise safety concerns without being retaliated against. - Low Pressure - <strong>ex</strong> FBI - not very policitized in recent decades 5. culture of independance - culture of operating on expertise, indep. from political pressure - high independance &amp; discretion 6. concentrated benefits vs. distributed costs - Sometimes agencies don’t really go away even when they don’t scale with GDP - <strong>ex</strong> (TVA) TN Valley Authority - provide electricity for people suffering in the great depression. - its a clientele agency - small gp of people invested in what it does. People who use lakes / electricity would be up in arms if it were closed. - But at the same time no constituency to remove it. - <strong>ex</strong>: UCSB - somebody lives in San Muigel on 2nd floor. Imagine plan where people get $500 per month. Would cost $5 per quarter for <em>all</em> students to pitch in. Regents have a meeting at 7:30 AM in Campbell Hall. - What happens at later meeting, after 2 quarters? People who have adjusted lives around this extra money. They are going to be SUPER motivated to voice support for this. So small but vocal advocacy can keep it going. 7. desires of Congress and the President - Congress passes a budget every year which controls funding for agencies. - They can subpoena people from agencies to explain what they did - Conflict / Tension between congress and president over regulations on agencies.</p>

If there’s ambiguity then that’s a question for congress. - [sc] Marbury vs Madison <!-- todo lookup --> - Roberts in rucho case on gerrymandering : Roberst says its not SCs job to deal with this problem. - <strong>Contemporary Meaning</strong> - no deference to congress to solve meaningful problems - judge says “we’re going to apply the old law to new situation” - <strong>ex</strong> [1964] civil rights -&gt; sex then means no gender discrimination now. - part of process is interpreting constitution using your own theory in your mind and make a legal argument / ruling about it - this seems a bit sketchy - SC delegated to states things that Fed hasn’t made laws on - ? - somewhat acts in loosely responsive way to public opinion - has to make decisions that public will agree to - power - president could appoint more justices - !! Things are too heavily reliant on <strong>consent</strong> and <strong>good faith</strong> - ? Could this be improved with more checks &amp; balances?</p>

<h2 id="public-polarization">Public Polarization</h2>
<p>Is the public as polarized as congress? - Basic polarization: Clustering around extreme positions. distribution-distance - <strong><code>Ideological Polarization</code></strong>: Parties diverge with one another on policy positions - <strong><code>Affective Polarization</code></strong>: Parties diverge with one another based on their <em>feelings</em> towards one another, not their pilicy preferences. - not about issues. about <strong>affect</strong> ~ emotion. - <strong><code>Partisan Sorting</code></strong>: Political parties are more distunct form one another idologicaally, resulting in little ideological overlap. - “more extreme candidates being elected to (both) major parties”</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Is the Public Polarized?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Yes, but its complicated.</li>
<li>Not much ideological polarization (policy differences)
<ul>
<li>people can ‘change’ their opinions if their party supports it, because its uncomforatble to not agree with your party.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A gread deal of widespread affective polarization (dislike of other party)</li>
<li>Better sorted parties make the public <em>look</em> more polarized
