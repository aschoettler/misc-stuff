<h1 id="chapter-1---the-five-principles-of-politics">Chapter 1 - The Five Principles of Politics</h1>
<!-- 
Intro

Complicated organization & authority of govt is good for preventing monarchy **but** makes it confusing.
Many americans don't know how stuff works, even basic stuff about constitution.

Questions for political scientists:

- What do we observe? - descriptive
- Why do we observe that? - analytical
- What _should_ be the way things work? -->
<!-- **`Government`**
- Formal political arrangements for ruling
- Institutions and processes that rulers establish to strengthen and perpetuate their power/control over a land and its inhabitants.
- _Autocracy_: Single ruler
- _Oligarchy_: Small group of people hold control
- _Democracy_: Citizens play significant part in govt process
- _Constitutional_: Formal limits powers of govt
- _Authoritarian_: No formal limits but may be limited by institutions
- _Totalitarian_: No formal limits, Seeks to absorb / eliminate institutions that may limit it
 -->
<p><strong><code>Politics</code></strong> - refers to <strong>conflicts</strong> - Conflicts over the leadership, structure, and policies - Goal is to have a say in how govt is organized / what policies will be - Ex: Individuals can get involved,</p>
<h2 id="principles">Principles</h2>
<h3 id="i---rationality">I - Rationality</h3>
<p><strong>Governments respond to what people want</strong></p>
<p>Main idea: - People have goals which influence their behavior. In particular their political goals affect their political behavior. - Goals can be social, personal - Political behavior: watching debate, go to city council meeting, cast vote. - Politicians: most acts are political, have ramifications - Their goals are political</p>
<p>Goals: - Elected politicians: - (Electoral) <code>electoral connection</code>: <strong>Keep jobs, gain power</strong>, move to more prominent positions - ideally, challenge of winning elections motivated politicians to help constituents - (Personal) ideological / personal reasons - (Institutional) Committee Assignment - Agency heads -&gt; budget / funding - Legislative chairs -&gt; jurisdiction - voters -&gt; personal &amp; broader benefit - justices -&gt; prevailing interpretation of constitution</p>
<p>Means / Outcomes - <code>Retail politics</code>: working directly with constituents - <code>Wholesale politics</code>: appealing to groups of constituents - (Personal): personal connection to policy motivates Congressman to vote for it - (Electoral):</p>
<h3 id="ii---institution">II - Institution</h3>
<p><strong>Institutions Structure Politics</strong></p>
<p>Main Idea: - Institutions are routinized, structured relations which allow gov actors to address recurring problems or facilitate pursuing goals - They organize political activity</p>
<p>Terminology relating to structure of some institutions: - <code>Jurisdiction</code>: The domain where an institution / member has authority - <strong>ex</strong> FDA has jurisdiction / authority over marketing drugs. - <code>Agenda Power</code>: Power to control which items are put to a vote - <code>Veto Power</code>: power to override a vote - <code>Decisiveness rules</code>: A specification of when a vote may be taken and the sequence in which votes occur - <strong>ex</strong> the Senate rule that says a vote can be forced without further debate with 60 votes. - <code>Delegation</code> - Transmission of authority to some other official or body - <strong>ex</strong> president can delegate to cabinet officials - <code>Principals &amp; Agents</code> - A principal can delegate to an agent to do some task - Challenge for leader: (1) make sure follower has aligned motives, (2) don’t expend too much cost policing delegated decisions. - <strong>ex</strong> Representative Democracy</p>
<h3 id="iii---collective-action">III - Collective Action</h3>
<p><strong>All Politics Is Collective Action</strong></p>
<p>Main idea: - People work together to achieve mutual political goals</p>
<p>Terms: - <code>Bargaining</code>: negotiation - can be formal or informal - Problem: When people act purely in self interests they can end up worse off than - <code>Collective Action</code> = political cooperation in a group</p>
<!-- todo -->
<ul>
<li>equilibrium
<ul>
<li>skew toward middle or polarization?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>media used to be tool for politician, now turntables.</li>
<li>Fo</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="iv---policy">IV - Policy</h3>
<p><strong>Political Outcomes Are the Products of Individual Preferences and Institutional Procedures</strong></p>
<p>Policy is the result of a combination of: - rationality – because votes to enact a policy can be motivated by ambitions - collective action – because groups can influence how people vote <!-- * ? --></p>
<h3 id="v---history">V - History</h3>
<p><strong>History influences future</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ex</strong> Shea’s Rebellion: delegates learned that in order for confederation to work they must have more power at the national level</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="chapter-2---the-constitution">Chapter 2 - The Constitution</h1>
<p><strong>Federalism and Anti-Federalism</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shays’ Rebellion, 1787</strong>
<ul>
<li>some people in Massachusetts didn’t want state legislature <!-- power & SCOTUS --> to pass some new legislation that would put them in debt. So they terrified them by trying to take over the national munitions @ springfield. Within a few days the Fed. had regained control of situation.</li>
<li>Demonstrated that the <strong>Articles of Confederation</strong> weren’t meeting needs, so <strong>Alexander Hamilton</strong>’s Annapolis Resolution was passed by the representatives at the whatever event.</li>
<li>Resolution said every state must send delegates to Philadelphia where they will plan better things.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Motivation for Redesigning the Articles of Confederation: * Wanted <strong>protection for commerce and property</strong> against radical state legislatures. * ship piracy for southern states * debtor revolt for larger states * Resist populist interests hostile to elites</p>
<p><strong>First Constitutional Convention, 1787</strong> - Delegates from every state (except Rhode Island) - Virginia Proposal: originally proposed bicameral gov structure - <strong><code>Great Compromise</code></strong>: Agreement between larger &amp; smaller states to have representation in Fed that was <strong>bicameral</strong> – divided into two chambers - where larger states had proportional representation in the house and the smaller states got equal rep. in the senate. - The two chambers had different powers</p>
<p><strong>Three Fifths Compromise</strong> - Northern states: didn’t want slaves to count for representation - southern states: wanted slaves to count for representation - -&gt; Three Fifths compromise for determining <em>legislation</em> (slaves still <strong>not</strong> allowed to vote). - Premonition of</p>
<p><strong>todo</strong> - pg ~40(?) something about <strong>interests aligning with principles</strong> - delegates motivated to do something better than articles of confederation –&gt; they made BIG compromises. - <strong>Aside</strong> - <code>md       I think this point is **really** interesting -- Part of the reason that the structure of the constitution was so "brilliant" wasn't because the framers were these immaculate geniuses -- there were **concerned** representatives from **every state** who came together because they all understood that the status quo - the ACs - weren't good enough. Everybody disliked them and they all wanted something better.</code> - population swing -&gt; senate elections &amp; 6yr terms</p>
<h3 id="legislative-branch---article-i">Legislative Branch - Article I</h3>
<p>Structure: - House of Representatives - Members elected by direct elections - Representation proportional to state population - Terms: 2 years - Goals: - directly responsible to the people - Powers: - Originate legislation about finance &amp; commerce - change structure of federal courts - Senate - Members (originally) appointed by state leg. - Representation equal for each state - Terms: 6 years &amp; staggered - avoid complacence in quick changes of public opinion. - Goals: - guard against excessive democracy - Powers: - Approve treaties - Approve federal judges</p>
<p>Powers of the Legislative Branch: - Express Powers - declare war, levy taxes, regulate commerce and currency, … - Necessary and Proper Clause [A1.8] - Power to enact laws necessary &amp; proper to implement powers given to congress OR any other branch / office of the Fed.</p>
<h3 id="the-executive-branch---article-ii">The Executive Branch - Article II</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hamilton wanted “energy”</li>
</ul>
<p>Goals: - Make Fed the agency for timely and decisive action to deal with public issues and problems - Hamilton called this “energy” - Withstand excessively democratic pressures by doing indirect elections. Powers: - Accept ambassadors - negotiate treaties - grant pardons, except in cases of impeachment - appoint major departmental personnel (<strong>ex</strong> FBI Director) - convene congress in a special session - Veto congressional enactments - can be overridden by two-thirds majority</p>
<h3 id="judicial-branch---article-iii">Judicial Branch - Article III</h3>
<p>Goals: - Enhance power of Fed - check radical democratic impulses - guard against interference w/ liberty and property from the rest of the gov. Supreme Court: - Powers: - determine whether a power was usable by: (1) Fed only, (2) Fed &amp; states, or (3) states only. - determine whether a law is constitutional - resolve disputes between state &amp; federal courts - resolve cases between citizens of different states - Structure - Justices have lifetime appointments - Justices cannot have salaries reduced while serving</p>
<h1 id="chapter-3---federalism-and-the-separation-of-powers">Chapter 3 - Federalism and the Separation of Powers</h1>
<p>Some relevant principles for context: * Federalism - Principle of division of governance into federal and state levels. * Idea is that states retain some power as entities themselves. This allows them to retain some rights &amp; authority over themselves AND limits the potential power of the Fed. * Separation of Powers - Division of power of the federal government into 3 branches * The idea is that the branches limit each others power so no single part becomes too powerful * <code>Sovereignty</code>: Independent political authority.</p>
<p>Federalism in the Constitution - Who Decides What - Federal government Powers - [A1.8]: Express Powers - {collect taxes, coin money, declare war, regulate commerce} - [A1.8]: Implied Powers - “make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers” - [A6]: All national laws &amp; treaties are “supreme Law of the Land” - <strong>ex</strong>: Support for corn farmers - [A1.3]</p>
<h1 id="chapters-1-2-3">Chapters 1, 2, 3</h1>
<p>Federalism - - Federal government - Articles of Confederation - Replaced by Constitution</p>
<p>3 types: see lecture notes for details</p>
<h1 id="chapter-4---civil-liberties">Chapter 4 - Civil Liberties</h1>
<h2 id="where-do-civil-liberties-come-from">Where do Civil Liberties come from?</h2>
<p><strong><code>Civil Liberties</code></strong>: (ch4) Limits on what <strong>people</strong> may do freely in society. - They are restrictions on gov, so the limit the [#collective] decisions people make via congress. - <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights">Bill of <del>Rights</del> (Liberties)</a> [1791] - <strong>many provisions</strong> - [M1] Speech, press, religion, assembly - [M2] Bear arms - [M3] Soldiers - [M4] Search &amp; Seizures - [M5] Due Process, double jeopardy, self-incrimination - Miranda rights ([sc] [1966] Miranda v. Arizona) - [M6] Trial by Jury - [M7] $20 - [M8] Cruel &amp; Unusual Punishment - [M9] Not exhaustive - [M10] Other rights reserved to the States</p>
<p>HIstorical things: - Religion and the Establishment Clause - &gt; Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. - Jefferson “Wall of Separation” (of church &amp; state) - But some things have persisted, unchallenged by courts: money - Court struck down bible reading in public schools: “highly suggestive” - Court agreed that withholding money to a sports team b/c of religion was “viewpoint discrimination” - “under God” - added in in [1954] - upheld inconclusively in [sc] - 10 commandments issue: same justice made swing vote both ways [LGSA.115] - <strong>Thing</strong>: Religion cannot be part of any test required to hold office, BUT many <em>citizen voters</em> may choose not to vote for a particular candidate for <strong>any</strong> reason they want. - Time / Place / Manner regulation - [sc] [1940] Cantwell v. Connecticut - Court struck down a prison beard ban because it violated a man’s right to express his religion by growing a beard - Court held that when A&amp;F refused to hire a Muslim woman because her head scarf violated company dress code, they were engaging in religious discrimination. <!-- * I think I personally agree with the court here - inclusive vision --></p>
<h2 id="notable-cases-in-civil-liberties-history">Notable Cases in Civil Liberties History</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>[sc] [1971] Lemon v. Kurtzman
<ul>
<li><strong>Lemon Test</strong> - The national or sate governments MAY make a policy dealing with religion IF:
<ul>
<li>policy must have a Secular Purpose,</li>
<li>primary effect neither advance nor prohibit religion, AND</li>
<li>govt doesn’t become excessively entangled w religion</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>ex</strong>: Laws to force religion to be taught in school is NOT ok because it fails 1 and 3.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>[sc] Miller v. CA
<ul>
<li><strong>Miller Test</strong> - The government MAY restrict “obscene” speech, defined as speech which:
<ul>
<li>appeals to a prurient interest (according to contemporary community standards),</li>
<li>depicts sexual or excretory conduct in a patently offensive way; AND</li>
<li>taken as a whole lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Two exceptions to Obscenity Standard:
<ul>
<li>minors do not have full [M1] rights; their exposure to non-obscene material MAY be regulated.</li>
<li>broadcasting is a special form of communication that is due weaker [M1] protection; because of inadvertency and children’s access.
<ul>
<li>different from, say, printed material because if you pick up a magazine/book/tape to read/listen to it, you are “opting-in” to consuming that content. If you don’t like it you can choose to stop. But radio / cable news must have restrictions because listeners don’t know what’s coming / can’t disengage as easily.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>[sc] Brandenburg V. Ohio - <strong>“Imminent Lawless Action”</strong>
<ul>
<li>The government MAY regulate speech that speech is “directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.”</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="chapter-5---civil-rights">Chapter 5 - Civil Rights</h1>
<h2 id="what-are-civil-rights">What are Civil Rights?</h2>
<p><strong><code>Civil Rights</code></strong>: - Requirements on government and organizations regarding <strong>treatment of people</strong>, especially <strong>equal treatment</strong> - Rules that govern collective decision-making processes and outcomes - They <strong>do</strong> extend to private actors - Types - some govern <strong>who</strong> can be involved in [#collective] decisions &amp; political processes and <strong>how</strong> - <strong>ex</strong>: Who can vote, serve in office, have a trial, or serve on jury - some concern how people are <strong>treated</strong> in organizations and in society - <strong>ex</strong>: access to public facilities, schools, hospitals <!-- todo see TESTS --></p>
<p><strong>Examples of Civil Rights</strong> [LGSA.149] - Political - Voting (18+ y/o citizens) - citizenship - Legal - due process (everybody) - habeas corpus - right to see a court if charged w crime (everybody living on US soil) - Social - right to not be enslaved - marriage rights - right to work - own property - education - medical care @ emergency rooms - standard of living - due compensation if Gov takes property</p>
<p><strong>Principles</strong> 1. Civil rights should be <strong>Universal.</strong> - apply to everybody. 2. Civil rights should be <strong>Equal</strong> - all people with a right should have equal ability to practice it.</p>
<p><strong>Compare/Contrast Civil Liberties &amp; Civil Rights</strong> - in common: - restrictions on gov power - Differences: - CL makes provisions about people, regarding what people are allowed to do - protect peoples’ individual freedoms against potentially over-reaching government - CR makes restrictions on organizations, regarding how they can treat different groups of people - protect peoples’ treatment, access, and participation in context of potentially discriminating organizations or institutions</p>
<p><strong>Relevance</strong> - US provides civil rights many other nations don’t have - When injustices need fixing, new civil rights can be extended. - Its up to people / processes to determine if/how to extend civil rights.</p>
<p>Requirements on government (and be extension <strong>private actors</strong>) to provide equal treatment of people - regulate <strong>who</strong> can participate and <strong>how</strong> (juries, voting, due process) - Rules that Gov must follow regarding treatment of people</p>
