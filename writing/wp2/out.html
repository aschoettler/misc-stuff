<p>Were you one of the 147 million Americans affected by the Equifax data breach in 2017? Many people whose data was stolen by the hackers in the breach found it difficult even to find out that their information had been exposed. This scandal serves as just one example of a critical failure of technological systems to meet the requirements of the <span class="math inline">21^{st}</span> century. Services are now entrusted with more personal information on users than ever before, and this simple fact makes them an increasingly attractive target for hackers or malicious actors who may seek to profit from that data. By the term “services,” we mean any web-based application that people or companies use to accomplis some task. For example, Gmail is a “service” offered by Google which provides users (people, organizations, teams, etc) with email capabilities. Facebook is a service which many users enjoy for its online content, and the list goes on. Another important kind of service to know about is the class of services which harness the power of “Internet of Things” devices. So-called “IoT” devices, like smart thermostats, or smart light bulbs, can change their behavior based on data they collect while in use, or by internet-delivered instructions. Some services, like one hosted by Nest, run on their company servers (the “cloud”) and provide users with data-driven temperature scheduling tailored to their routine. IoT devices are increasingly prevalent due to the cheap power and efficiency provided by small, low-power circuits in a huge array of devices. With millions of devices being sold, there’s an order of magnitude of new potential for gathering more widespread and detailed data. This leads to a critical question that only few have been asking: “How are users going to be confident that their data is handled securely?” It’s an important question at the center of an active area of research in the information security discourse community, the home of other data security problems pre-dating the advent of IoT devices. The medium for this community is the space of journal articles written by researchers, and the content of the articles reflects their principal, common value: robust, guaranteed security which can protect people at the individual level. In today’s data-collection economy, the work of this community is centrally important. In this essay we’ll examine two articles, “Blind IFTTT: Privacy Enhancing Technologies for Trigger-Action IoT Platforms” ([A-20]) and “Replication is not needed: single database, computationally-private information retrieval” ([KD-97]). These two papars present different kinds of contributions to the same community. But despite their differences, these articles represent a couple interesting patterns among work in this space. First, as journal articles, they demonstrate and adhere to common conventions of the research community including argumentation and evidentiary practices. And in-line with the practices of the security research community, they reflect the universal value of privacy protection. Second, we notice that in connection with their differing and unique contributions, the two articles demonstrate variation within the discourse community across several rhetorical dimensions, including their level of technicality and their narrative choices.</p>
<p>To analyze the rhetorical dimensions of the texts at hand, it will help to understand what they are aiming to communicate and how that is related to protecting privacy The “cPIR” article ([KO-97]) tackles a problem called “Information Retrieval.” To understand this problem, imagine there are two people, Alice and Bob. Bob keeps a list of values, indexed <span class="math inline">x_1, x_2, ...</span> etc. Alice wants Bob to send her one of the values, and she knows she wants the <span class="math inline">i^{th}</span> value, but its important to her that Bob not know which value she wanted. Its okay if Bob knows she’s getting <em>some</em> value from his list, but she wants to keep the <em>index</em> <span class="math inline">i</span> a secret. Prior to this article’s publishing, the best solution to this problem was to have Bob’s list stored in two copies on different servers, where the security mainly stemmed from the requirement that the two servers hosting the list not be allowed to communicate with one another. With the protocol described in the paper, the authors describe a system that requires <em>only one</em> computer on Bob’s end, meaning Alice no longer has to assume the same level of trust she did in the previous scenario, in assuming that the two computers would not communicate with each other. The security of this protocol is based on an assumption that a particular math problem (“deciding <em>quadratic residuosity</em>”) is difficult to solve without the key information that only Alice has. Cleverly, Kushilevitz and Ostrovsky show that this is enough to protect Alice’s data. The “Blind IFTTT” article ([A-20]), currently in submission, works to address the security of a larger online service called IFTTT. The company, “If-This-Then-That” is a service which offers users the ability to connect their other services and IoT devices to its platform, and allows them to configure certain rules called ‘applets’ to run when certain ‘trigger’ events happen. For example, if a person has a Philips Hue light bulb and an Uber account, she can make an applet which runs every time she arrives home via Uber, which ‘triggers’ the light to turn on. Or, an applet could send an email alert or mobile notification if a weather station predicts rain the next day. An applet could even post a tweet on your behalf with a link to your new favorite song on Spotify, if you add that song to a specific public playlist. The downside of a system with this much functionality however, is that IFTTT learns a lot of personal inforation about its users when they set up and use these applets. The authors identify this issue and propose some alternative protocols which they claim do a better job of protecting users’ privacy and sensitive data. With this context in hand, we can delve into to the articles to learn more about the broader discourse community.</p>
<p>Within the discourse community of academic security research journal articles, content follows a clear theme which reflects the values of the community: <em>constructive work</em> which provides new <em>techniques</em> and <em>methods</em> for solving <em>privacy-related</em> problems, with <em>concrete claims</em> backed by <em>rigorous proofs</em>. Articles typically discuss progress that the authors have made in identifying and/or solving a certain problem. The problem can be one that the authors identify, as is the case in [A-20], or one that has already been posed, and which the authors have made new progress on (this is the case for [KD-97]). The two articles demonstrate the importance of privacy among works in the field. While the Kushilevitz article discusses a protocol which protects a users privacy by hiding sensitive data, the [A-20] paper aims to improve the privacy properties of IFTTT by using a variant of the existing protocol. The academic rigor of the field demands a high bar for argumentation. Claims must be precise and falsifiable, and authors bear the burden of proof in establishing the claims that they make. Depending on the kind of claim they make, authors typically show some combination of proof and analysis to substantiate their claims. When the claim involves some aspect of information protection, or “Who can know What” kinds of claims, proofs often adopt the language of probability theory. In [KD-97], the authors make claims about the difficulty of a certain math problem, so they have a proof incorporating number theory to back it up. In the [A-20] article, the authors make claims about the security of a broader, more complex application, and back them up with careful argumentation rather than a literal proof. The most common type of flaw in these kinds of arguments is the absence of an argument that covers some particular scenario which may be unexpected. So the biggest challenge authors face in this kind of argumentation is the requirement of thoroughly ‘covering the bases.’ Finally, the [KD-97] article reinforces its claims of practicality by presenting results from a simulated evaluation of their protocol which they programmed and tested. Such a “Performance Evaluation” is a form of evidence common among articles discussing systems and applications. These articles show the common value of privacy protection central to the community, and represent the associated argumentation conventions. But they also demonstrate unique rhetorical choices which highlight the respective authors’ specific goals.</p>
<p>The differences in the level of technicality and the narrative choices emplyed in the two articles reflect their unique audiences and goals. While the [KD-97] paper is more technical, and focused toward a narrower audience, the “Blind IFTTT” article is aimed at a much broader audience. The [KD-97] article proposes a new piece of math as a technique to solve an existing problem where research has already been done. They aim to communicate their proposed scheme to an audience already familiar with the problem, so their delivery is concise and uses an appropriate level of jargon without detailed background. In the second sentence of the paper, they use common jargon and announce that “based on the quadratic-residuosity assumption, we present a <em>single-database</em>, computationally-private information-retrieval scheme with <span class="math inline">O(n^\epsilon)</span> communication complexity for any <span class="math inline">\epsilon &gt; 0</span>. They then transfer quickly into the background required to understand why their contribution is an improvement over previous work. The way the paper describes itself is concrete and straightforward. But the other article differs from this one in many of these regards. The”Blind IFTTT" is more approachable to a many readers with more varied backgrounds. The article presents a solution to a problem which they have identified, that is tangible and relevant to the context of modern technology. They spend a few leisurely paragraphs in the introduction describing the importance of security in the IoT-infused world, how IFTTT is related to that context, and the motivation or importance about why people should care. They emphasize the modern security narrative and greater context of their work, noting that “cloud-based centralized architecture makes these platforms an attractive target for attackers, as demonstrated by recent incidents targeting the cloud services of famous companies, including Marriott, Equifax, Yahoo and Target” ([A-20]). These articles differ significantly in their narrative choices and intended level of technicality, despite their similarities in the context of the discourse community.</p>
<p>The discourse community of academic research articles in security and information privacy is home to many discoveries and developments which improve the real-world capabilities of software. The academic nature of journal articles imposes a high level of necessary rigor for authors, and meeting this standard is an important indicator of effective writing in this area. Even so, authors have their own freedom to operate within those conventions, as we see in these two articles.</p>

<p>This was a cool assignment that I enjoyed because it allowed me to think about the similarities and differences of two journal articles in ways that I found really interesting.</p>
<p>It took me quite a while to decide on a thesis statement to use because it seemed like there were a lot of different angles I could approach the analysis from. When we talked about what I could do for the thesis and overall structure of the paper, you mentioned I could look at the ways that the papers presented arguments and evidence, and I was thinking at the same time that I could do an analysis of what the common goals are for the discourse community and explain how the articles each have content that embodies those values, and furthers the broader goals of the discourse community. I wasn’t sure if I had to decide between those two things as overall strategies for writing the essay, and worse yet - while I was doing the rough draft I thought of yet another kind of thing I could analyze (that became the “level of technicality” / audience / conciseness section). Fortunately, I realized that there was a relatively nice way to incorporate all the interesting ideas that I had into one larger structure that looks at similarities among papers in the broader discourse community (which are the argumentation / evidence-presenting conventions, as well as the shared value of privacy). Then afterwards I broke down the differences between the papers, so in the end it reminded me a lot of the overall structure I used for WP1.</p>
<p>One sort of image I have in my head that I use to think about this is a venn diagram. The papers have similarities, which represent patterns in the broader discourse community, but they also have their own, diverging goals which I argued dictate their different choices when it comes to “rhetorical dimensions.” So it was cool to think about having one venn diagram that represents the similarities and differences of the papers from the perspective of “What are the goals” / “What can we learn about the discourse community” on the one hand, and then parallel to that, on another level, there’s the venn diagram that analyzes the question of “What are the rhetorical features” of the essays. And then, with those two layers of venn diagrams, I realized the strong connections between the layers: the goal of having a quick short mathy article that uses some jargon and a couple proofs totally motivates the concise organization of that article, the fact that they use somewhat specialized jargon, and the fact that its pretty to-the-point. But on the other side, you have the goals of the other article, and its whole other set of rhetorical features that make sense given its position. I tried to convey all that using the right thesis and overall structure, and I hope it comes across.</p>
