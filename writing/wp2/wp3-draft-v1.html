    <p>To the Honorable Senator from the Great State of Tennessee,</p>
    <p>I am writing to you to express my utmost dissatisfaction regarding the outcome of recent presidential general
      elections, and to urge you to throw your support behind the proposed “National Popular Vote” bill (HB 1728). As a
      fellow proponent of ideals of fair democracy I’m sure you will understand why this and other election reforms
      would be a great benefit to our electoral system.</p>
    <p>Elections in this country have undergone a troubled and imperfect history but they could stand to improve in a
      number of key ways.</p>
    <p>Prior to the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964, discrimination at the ballot box against black voters cast
      a stain on our democracy. And before the advent of the 19th amendment to the Constitution our own mothers and
      daughters did not have the ability to vote. Indeed, the day of August 18, 1920, when Tennessee became the 36th
      state to ratify that amendment and put it into effect nationally, was truly a momentous point in our great state’s
      history. But Senator I call on you today to bring your attention to another opportunity you have to improve the
      freeness and fairness of elections in our state and our country. Under the constitution, Tennessee has the
      authority to appoint Electors to reflect its preference in the US presidential in any manner it chooses. The
      National Popular Vote bill (HB 1728) would provide that Tennessee’s electors support whichever presidential
      candidate wins the national popular vote. As recent elections have shown, the outcome of the popular vote does not
      always have a strong bearing on who wins the presidency. For example, if memory serves well, I voted years ago for
      Andrew Jackson’s presidential candidacy in 1824. And more voters cast their ballots for Jackson than for any of
      his three competitors. But when none of the four of them was able to surmount a majority of the electoral college
      votes, I was astonished that the race could be decided by the House of Representatives – who handed the victory to
      John Quincy Adams!</p>
    <p>I’m sure that you, distinguished among congressmen as a Tennessean senator, can appreciate how signing the bill
      before you today could bring about much needed changes to our system. Changes that Andrew Jackson, who once held
      your very same office, would have no doubt appreciated.</p>
    <p>Thank you for your time</p>
