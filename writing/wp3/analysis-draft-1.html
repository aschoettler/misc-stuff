<p>In this project I decided to work on a transformation from a chapter of my political science textbook, (LGSA), to a letter to a congressperson. I chose topics covered in the chapter on elections to reflect in the letter which I think are important issues in the american politics today and which are especially relevant to the current 2020 election cycle. It’s not necessarily a letter I’d personally write to a congressperson, but the transformation from an academic political text to a congressional letter seemed like an interesting transformation process.</p>
<p>The textbook, [LGSA], is a textbook I’m reading as part of the “American Government and Politics” course (PS 12) in the Political Science department. As a textbook it features long, detailed chapters with sourced information about aspects of american democracy. The authors write about a wide range of content including the historical foundations of american democracy, the various institutions in our government and how interact with each other, and analysis with connections to modern political events today. The genre of the textbook is an academic textbook, meant to inform students (specifically those learning political science) taking a college-level introductory course about american government. Some noteworthy features of the academic textbook genre are the primarily student-based audience, and the curriculum-focused, informative purpose. The textbook also demonstrates a steady even-handed, neutral and objective approach to delivering information. This is important for a textbook which aims to guide students, but as I learned later, this aspect of the text does not always transfer well to a congressional letter. The textbook fits into the academic political science discourse community, but it is not highly immersed within the field. Its highly approachable to any competent reader who has taken any US history course, but it does not overwhelm the reader with the fineries of more specialized political science studies.</p>
<p>The destination genre of my text transformation was the genre of letters to congressional representatives. The audience of these texts are elected representatives at local, state and national levels. The context for each one are typically government policies or programs which the representative can influence. Letters from constituents often ask their representatives to do specific actions or to vote for or against specific pieces of legislation. The purpose of these letters is for people to communicate to their elected legislators their own values and interests, and to specifically ask that person to take action that in a way that reflects those values. A common feature of this genre is the polite tone that writers often use when writing to their representatives. To write an effective letter, it is best [LETTER] to back up any claims with facts as evidence. Writers are also encouraged <!-- wc: optional --> to include a personal in their letter which can make it more tangible. In comparing these two genres, I noticed that the primary difference in the content of the texts is that while the textbook genre usually has a neutral voice on the material, letters to congresspeople are not. Since the writer’s purpose in the latter case is to persuade or urge the reader to do something specific, the content is centered around that aim. A secondary difference is the length and level of detail of the texts. Since textbooks must be detailed, the length suits the purpose. However when a congresswoman takes time out of her schedule to read letters, she may not be available to read especially long letters. Thus the format requires writers to be brief.</p>
<p>In my genre transformation I selected several areas from the chapter on elections to convert into the letter format, including voter ID laws, voter turnout, redistricting and campaign finance laws. I chose these topics because they are all related to elections, which are a central part of the democratic process in the US. And since congress itself writes many laws governing election procedures, they are an appropriate audience to pursue if a person sees a problem or injustice in the way elections are organized and managed. For example, Voter ID laws are designed to prevent voter fraud. But studies have shown that voter fraud is not a statistically significant factor in modern elections. However, the book states that “opponents argue that these laws are designed to reduce voting on the part of poor (often minority) voters who may not have drivers’ licenses or other required forms of identification” (LGSA). Voter turnout has been significantly lower in the past century than in the 1800s. Although the turnout rate has increased over the last 24 years, it is still under 65% nationally. One factor that reduces voter turnout is the perception that many peoples’ votes “don’t matter.” This is partly due to gerrymandering which, according to the textbook, demonstrates “significant evidence of partisan bias” in the maps state governments draw. <!-- wc infinitive -->` by state governments which can have a huge effect on local elections. Fortunately, some groups have made efforts over the past decade to make the process more transparent and “open”. Finally, campaign finance law has changed significantly in the past decade; this change was marked by the supreme court ruling in 2010 in the case of “Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission.” The ruling allowed Super PACs to “spend unlimited amounts on campaigns, though Super PACs are subject to more disclosure laws.” (LGSA 474). Each of these aspects surrounding election laws are potential causes of concern for many voters, and which a congressperson or senator could have a role in changing, with enough constituent and legislative support. So for each of these issues, I mentioned in the letter the effects of the laws currently in place and how they may adversely affect various groups, and asked the representative to support specific active legislation which addresses those concerns.</p>
<p>In order to transform these topics from the textbook into a letter to a congressional representative, I needed to find ways to transfer the content of the text into the substance of a persuasive argument that a constituent may write to his/her representative. Since the textbook does not voice a strong opinion when it comes to policy decisions, I had to prescribe a stance for the writer to take, and use evidence from the text to bolster their claims. But I personally feel that these aspects of elections are pertinent today in the 2020 election cycle, and that that a congressional letter is an appropriate way to convey the content of the textbook in a persuasive format to a person who actually can influence the status quo.</p>

<p>restructure: make the huge paragraphs smaller restructure to go deeper into the analysis compare the genres you were faced with and explain the choices you made in executing the transformation Add evidence from course readings Find more genre features to talk about style tone voice person even just using more of those words ^^ There are MYRIAD grammatical errors!! incorporate readings from class Comment: &gt; The two paragraphs explain the two genre very concretely, but I think you can shorten and combine those two together (to give a general idea of some differences between these two) and pay more attention on the authorial choices you made.</p>
