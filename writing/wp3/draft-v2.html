<p>March 2020</p>
<p>To the Honorable Senator from th Great State of Virginia,</p>
<p>As a constituent and an advocate for my fellow Americans, I am writing to you to express my dissatisfaction with the electoral system of this country and to ask for your support in advocating for electoral reforms regarding voter ID laws, voter representation, and campaign finance changes.</p>
<p>I have noticed that in the past few years, voter ID laws have been a topic of heated discussion in modern politics. Advocates say that they are intended to prevent voter fraud among undocumented workers and foreign residents. And on its face this is an understandable concern. But Senator, the facts are clear: Voter fraud is a statistically insignificant factor in modern elections. In fact, the effect of laws requiring government-issued identification at the ballot box is to discount the voices of poorer, often minority voters who may not have drivers’ licenses or other required documents. The real injustice at stake in the debate over these laws is the risk of denying access to vote for many of our local communities.</p>
<p>Second, I would urge you to support legislation which outlaws gerrymandering for state and local governments. With the technological tools available to governments today, its easier than ever to create redistricting maps which disadvantage specific groups and communities by establishing detailed correlations between voting patterns of specific groups and their geographic distribution. And the effect is that state legislators in power can control the relative significance of individuals’ votes based on predicted voting patterns of their demographic. Research has even shown significant evidence of partisan bias in maps across the country which are in effect today. In Mississippi, racially-motivated redistricting prevented the state from having any black legislators in the national congress until 1987. While the Supreme Court has ruled that gerrymandering on the basis of race is unconstitutional, the issue of partisan bias is yet to be outlawed. As a powerful voice in our government, I hope you can utilize your influence to advocate for legislation that will ban gerrymandering for good.</p>
<p>On a national scale, the electoral college demonstrates a similar problem. Electoral representation may not be as nefariously constructed as gerrymandered redistricting maps, but the system allows some peoples’ votes to have a greater influence in presidential elections than others. In one politically unlikely, but mathematically possible scenario, a candidate could win a general election with electors representing just 22% of the popular vote, by winning 51% of the popular vote in each of the 39 states that have the highest electors-to-voters ratio, plus the District of Columbia. But historically, there have been 4 presidential elections where the candidate who won a majority of the popular vote lost to his opponent who won a majority of the electoral college. Our government is one of many democracies around the world, and features of our government have served as models for later democracies, including our constitution and multi-branched government. The electoral college on the other hand is uniquely American, but several states have found a way to remedy its flaws through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. In the state legislature there is a bill to sign Virginia onto the agreement, which would require participating states to allocate their electors to whichever general election candidate wins the national popular vote. This agreement would not put Virginia at a disadvantage to other states, because it would only go into effect when enough states, comprising a majority of the electoral college, sign onto the pact. By signing onto this agreement, you can help make US elections more free and democratic.</p>
<p>Finally, campaign finance regulations have become weaker since the Supreme Court’s ruling in <em>Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</em> (2010), allowing companies and corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money on promotional materials for any public office election. There are regulations on how much they can donate to individual candidates and their campaigns, but these regulations fall woefully short of controlling both the magnitude and transparency of influence that corporations can devote to a candidate. In 2016, Super PACs spent $1.2 Billion on the presidential election. To eliminate the corrosive effects that powerful corporations can have on our political system I would appreciate your attention concerning legislation that would tighten these regulations.</p>
<p>I’m sure you can see how supporting these electoral reforms could benefit the political system in our country, so that it addresses the technical realities and financial forces present today. I encourage you to consider the benefits these changes could bring to our politics, and the broader impact you could have by helping Virginia to lead other states in these efforts.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
