<p>In this project I decided to do a transformation from a chapter of my political science textbook to a letter to a congressperson. I chose topics covered in the chapter on elections which I think are important issues in american politics today and which are especially relevant to the current 2020 election cycle. The textbook, <em>American Government: Power and Purpose</em> (LGSA), is a textbook I’m reading as part of the “American Government and Politics” course (PS 12) in the Political Science department. This textbook exemplifies several qualities of the broader genre including a student-focused audience and a primarily informative purpose. Additionally, it demonstrates several rhetorical features including stylistic and tonal choices which are appropriate for the genre. In contrast, the genre of letters to representatives implies a notably different audience and purpose, and stark differences in a rhetorical situation that is more directed and personal.</p>
<p>The primary audience of the textbook consists of students, especially political science pupils, taking a college-level introductory course about american government. The purpose of academic texts like LGSA is to provide a rich source of detailed information to apprentice learners in the field. The authors achieve this purpose by including long, detailed chapters with well-sourced information about myriad aspects of american democracy. They guide the reader through a wide range of content including the historical foundations of american government, its various institutions and the interplay between them, and supplementary detailed analysis connecting political theory to current political events. For comparison, letters to legislators often ask their representatives to do specific actions or to vote for or against specific pieces of legislation. The purpose of these letters is for people to communicate their own values and interests to their elected legislators, and to ask them to take action in a way that reflects those values. One way to understand the difference in roles for the audience and speakers of the two genres is to consider their levels of expertise: An experienced academic author writes a textbook for a student to learn about politics, while the writer of a letter is much less experienced than her audience, a professional politician experienced in navigating the government. While a textbook author writes to offer information, a constituent pens letters to express her opinion or make an argument.</p>
<p>In order to make this change to the audience of the text, I had to take informational language from the textbook and make it more reflective of the reader’s experience. While the book explains the background and history of the topics I included in the letter, I was able to assume that the reader would already know much of that context. But there were points where I reiterated some of that context in order to make a point clearer. For example I mentioned that the Citizens United ruling allowed “companies and corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money on promotional materials for any public office election.” The senator surely knows this, but it is useful to explain as context for the next sentence, which asserts that existing regulations are too weak. By explaining some background for context, while acknowledging that the reader is already an expert, the letter carries some aspects of the textbook’s informative nature, but also positions itself as a piece which encourages the reader to take the speaker’s position. Next, to transform the purpose of the text, I needed to take informative material from the book and convert it into a request for policy changes which the senator has authority over. For instance, textbook explains principles of the electoral college, but the speaker of the letter takes the stance that the senator should sign the bill, and that doing so would “help make US elections more free and democratic.” And to strengthen the message, I used directed second-person phrases like “I hope you can utilize your influence” which is a common way to convey a request (ASBMB). By asking the senator to take a position, the letter shares a similar type of purpose to others in the genre.</p>
<p>One stylistic concept closely related to the purpose of these texts is the differences in neutrality. The textbook presents an unbiased, neutral delivery of the content, and the authors do not advocate for or against any policies or stances on different issues. This is appropriate for the informative purpose because it a student to form opinions on her own, independently from her studies. In the book, the authors summarize the opinions of the advocates and opponents of voter ID laws. But in the letter, the speaker uses stronger language by reframing the issue around the negative effects of the laws: “The real injustice at stake in the debate over these laws is the risk of denying access to vote for many of our local communities.” Since congressional letters often explicitly ask a representative to take specific action, the language writers employ is tailored to that outcome.</p>
<p>One clear difference between textbooks and letters to congress are the lengths of the two types of texts, resulting from the logistic situation the reader is in. A student taking a course must be studious and devoted to learning the material from the book, so they are expected to spend substantial time reading the text and absorbing material. However the situation for a congressperson is quite different. Her priorities are to excel at the intricacies of legislation and politics, while representing her constituents’ interests. She may not have much time to read letters unless they are short, which is an important reason that the messages are so brief. To complete my transformation with the topics I had chosen to write about, I needed to condense and simplify the information from the book to a relatively concise overview of those issues. I did this by summarizing the most significant aspects of the topics I included. For example, in the section about gerrymandering, the speaker draws the implication that “state legislators in power can control the relative significance of individuals’ votes based on predicted voting patterns of their demographic.” This isn’t mentioned explicitly in the text, but it clearly demonstrates a problematic feature of the electoral college. By condensing the chosen topics to a few sentences about the most influential aspects of each one, I converted the detailed, thorough features of the textbook into a more concise format.</p>
